Fix Pig Random
===========================
![Header image](docs/pig.png)

Have you ever paused time in game and come back to an insane number of truffles? Well, that has to do with how pigs are programmed in game. This mod just slightly changes that so pausing time does not cause pigs to produce wayyyy more truffles.

## Install

1. Install the latest version of [SMAPI](https://smapi.io).
2. Download and install [AtraCore](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/12932).
2. Download this mod and unzip it into `Stardew Valley/Mods`.
3. Run the game using SMAPI.

## Uninstall
Simply delete from your Mods directory.

## Compatibility

* Works with Stardew Valley 1.5.6 on Linux/macOS/Windows.
* Works in single player, multiplayer, and split-screen mode. Should be fine if installed for only one player in multiplayer.
* Should be compatible with most other mods. Works for JA crops, but not DGA crops. Works with mods that change the growth time via CP, like [Balanced Valley](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/13970?tab=description) (except, well, not taking into account crops that take more than a month to grow.) Designed to work with my [More Fertilizers](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11837). Takes into account Walk of Life's Prestiged Agriculturalist.

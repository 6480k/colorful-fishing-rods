Event Tester
=================================

Helps you test events by running them automatically.

Basically, 1.6 has made event parsing much, much stricter. And there's no good way to test if your events work unless you just...run all of them. Which can take some time. But we can automate it! This mod simply plays events automatically, including every branch, to check for parsing errors. It does so at configurable speed.
